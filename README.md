## How to play?

You see a map of a random city.  All you have to do is to guess the correct country that the city is located.  Don't worry if you cannot spell: A list of countries will start showing after you type a few letters.

There are 10 questions.  You get your score after the 10 questions.  Sorry and no, I don't save your score. :-(

Don't worry if you still don't get it.  There's a quick walkthrough of the game for those of you who launch the game for the first time.

## Hints
1. Language. (Beware: Not only the French speaks French!)
2. Landmarks.
3. Shape of the roads.
4. Bodies of Water.
5. Have fun!
